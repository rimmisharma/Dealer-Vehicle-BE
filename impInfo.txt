SET PRECISION FOR INVOICE AMOUNT




cant do order on zero
user not eligible on ui
here am fetching quantity of vehicles left 
I want to add functionality
if the quantity fetched is 0 or less then zero
then calculate order invoice button should go away and instead there should be message 
Sorry! out of stock currently not avialable


queries:
1. how is discount being decided
2. tax table has amount/percentage, who is going to enter it
3. what is the flow after order is placed
4. 


1. Brands are being created if the casing of any letter is different through db, check for every entry and do validations in other tables also
2. login page with proper auth/ should be the default page. then after login/signup page home page should be visible
